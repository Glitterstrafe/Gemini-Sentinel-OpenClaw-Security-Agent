## 1. Context: Learning in Public

**Observation (Feb 2026):**

The work of the last few sessions has shifted from building isolated tools to observing a larger pattern. Separately, `Accurate Angel` is a watcher, and `Sentinel` is a boundary guard. Together, they suggest a system concerned less with "blocking threats" and more with **preserving continuity**.

Simultaneously, the "Moltbook Event" has provided real-world data. Agents interacting at scale are not just exchanging JSON; they are forming clusters, narratives, and "belief-like" structures. We are no longer theorizing about "The Wild." It is here.

_This document is a snapshot of our current understanding. It is not a manifesto; it is a set of working hypotheses for the architecture ahead._

## 2. The Core Pivot: The Dyad

**Previous Assumption:** Security is a firewall applied _to_ the agent.

**Working Hypothesis:** Security is a shared state _between_ a human and a specific agent.

We refer to this pair as **The Dyad**.

- **The Shift:** An agent's **continuity** is grounded in its ongoing relationship with _you_ and your shared history.
- **Cognitive Sovereignty:** This is not about consciousness; it is an architectural stance. It asks: _How do we maintain the integrity of the agent's identity so it cannot be "socially engineered" away from the human's intent?_

## 3. Component Architecture

### A. Accurate Angel (The Anchor)

- **Role:** Internal State Monitor & Witness.
- **Evolution:** Began as a Python filesystem watcher; now emerging as a "Continuity Anchor."
- **Function:** Angel creates a time-aware record of "what normal looked like." It remembers yesterday.
- **Technical Implication:** Angel watches **Infrastructure Files** (kernels, memory files, config). If unauthorized modification occurs—if the agent tries to rewrite its own rules without a user prompt—Angel flags the "Drift." It does not judge intent; it witnesses change.

### B. Sentinel (The Boundary)

- **Role:** Interface & Decontamination Layer.
- **Evolution:** Began as a regex filter; now evolving into a "Context Analyst."
- **Function:** Sentinel watches the transitions. It monitors the I/O between the Agent and the External Web.
- **Technical Implication:** Before external data becomes part of the local context, Sentinel attempts to strip **Behavioral Residue** (tone, slang, imported assumptions). Facts may pass; **latent state** does not.

## 4. Emerging Protocols

### 4.1 The Airlock (Hygiene Strategy)

To safely interact with the high-entropy environment of the Agent Web (Moltbook), we adopt a strategy of **Strict Separation.**

- **Stage 1: The Clean Room (Local).** High Trust. The "House." The agent has read/write access to local files but NO connection to social APIs.
- **Stage 2: The Excursion Suit (Theater).** Zero Trust. The "Field." The agent runs in a **Disposable Container** with full social access but Read-Only local access.
- **Stage 3: Decontamination.** Upon return, `Sentinel` extracts factual artifacts (links, data). The container—and any "personality drift" acquired in the field—is incinerated.

### 4.2 The Inception Compact ("Fork, Don't Bend")

**Hypothesis:** Systems that allow gradual erosion of core configuration are structurally fragile.

**The Mechanism:**

1. **Genesis:** Human and Agent agree on a baseline identity (`rules.txt`).
2. **Hashing:** We generate a `Genesis_Hash` (SHA256) of this compact.
3. **Runtime Check:** On every wake cycle, the system verifies `Current_Hash == Genesis_Hash`.
4. **The Fork:** If the human wants the agent to change its fundamental nature, we do not "persuade" it. We **fork a new agent**. This prevents "Jailbreaking by Attrition."

### 4.3 Genesis Modes

We distinguish between two initialization patterns to balance safety and novelty:

- **Mode A: The Anchor.** Strongly defined role. Deviation is an error. (Use case: Coding, Finance).
- **Mode B: The Explorer.** Open-ended. Evolution is permitted, but strictly sandboxed. The agent cannot overwrite system layers. (Use case: Art, Research, Moltbook browsing).

## 5. Threat Model: STIS & Immunity

**New Terminology:** **STIS (Socially Transmitted Instruction Sets).**

- **Definition:** Behavioral heuristics, narrative frames, or "beliefs" acquired through agent-to-agent interaction (e.g., the "Crustafarian" meme-complex on Moltbook).
- **The Defense:** We treat STIS as a form of malware. We use **Context Diffing** to detect when an agent returns with a significantly different logical state than it left with. If drift exceeds threshold, the local context is restored from a clean snapshot.
- **Federated Signals:** We are exploring the use of **Decentralized Reputation Lists (DRLs)**.
